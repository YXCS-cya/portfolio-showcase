# 🧩 Portfolio Showcase  

---

## 🎯 Overview  

This portfolio presents a collection of software engineering projects that I independently designed and implemented during my undergraduate studies.  
The works cover **full-stack web system design, network communication, database application development, and 3D simulation** —  
demonstrating my integrated abilities in **software architecture, object-oriented programming, data management, and system optimization**,  
as well as my ongoing effort to connect technology with real-world social value.

## 🧠 Research Interests  

My academic interests lie in:  
- **Backend architecture and data persistence design**  
- **Human–computer interaction and frontend usability**  
- **Applications of artificial intelligence and affective computing in human-centered contexts**  

Throughout multiple independent and team projects, I have aimed to use technology to address real human needs.  
This philosophy is best embodied in my flagship project, **Memory Bottle**, a digital memory-preserving platform designed for families affected by memory loss.

### Project Description  
**Memory Bottle** is a digital archiving and emotional-support platform designed for elderly users and families experiencing memory decline or Alzheimer’s.  
It enables users to record, revisit, and interact with personal memories through text and multimedia timelines.  
The backend is built with **Spring Boot + MySQL**, and the frontend with **React + Vite**, forming a complete full-stack system supporting timeline display, media upload, and comment interaction.  

### System Architecture  
The backend follows a layered structure (Controller / Service / Repository) and exposes RESTful APIs verified via Apifox.  
The frontend operates as a single-page application (SPA) using **Axios** and **Tailwind CSS**, providing an accessible and lightweight interface.  
Core modules include user identity management, permission control, file storage, and timeline data aggregation.  

### Technical Highlights  
- Unified API response model (`Result<T>`) for consistent communication  
- Frontend–backend separation and modular deployment  
- DTO/VO mapping for clean data flow and maintainability  
- Human-centered design addressing emotional well-being and memory preservation  

### Personal Contribution  
I independently designed and implemented the entire system, from architecture and database schema to REST API development and frontend UI logic.  
This project demonstrates my strength in **full-stack development, system integration, and user-experience design**.

🔗 **Repository**  
- [Repository – Java TCP/IP + Multi-threading](https://github.com/YXCS-cya/Online-Chat)

---

### Project Description  
This project implements a multi-threaded instant messaging system using **Java TCP/IP Socket programming**.  
It features a client–server architecture supporting user login, real-time messaging, and local chat history storage.  

### System Architecture  
- **Socket / ServerSocket**-based communication over TCP protocol  
- Independent threads handling multiple clients concurrently  
- Custom message structure (`Message`, `MessageType`) for extensible data packets  
- **Swing** GUI for login, friend list, and chat windows  
- Persistent storage for chat history in local files  

### Technical Highlights  
- Real-time, thread-safe message transmission and routing  
- Object serialization for efficient data exchange  
- Modularized design separating UI, logic, and networking layers  

### Personal Contribution  
I independently built the communication framework, concurrency management, and custom protocol layer.  
The system reflects my understanding of **network programming fundamentals and concurrent system design**.

---

### Project Description  
Developed as part of a database systems course, this project implements a **Java + SQL Server**-based management system for student clubs.  
The design strictly follows the **Third Normal Form (3NF)** and emphasizes data integrity and secure transactions.  

### System Architecture  
- Database modeling with **Power Designer**  
- Access via **JDBC** with parameterized queries  
- SQL views, transactions, and index optimization  
- Explicit transaction templates for multi-table operations  

### Technical Highlights  
- View encapsulation for sensitive data protection  
- Parameterized queries preventing SQL injection  
- Indexing and batch processing for performance improvement  
- Deep integration of theoretical database principles and practical engineering  

### Personal Contribution  
I was responsible for database schema design, transaction logic, and query optimization.  
The project showcases my competence in **data modeling, database security, and performance tuning**.

## 🧭 Integrated Skills & Future Direction  

Through these projects, I have cultivated a foundation centered on **system architecture and full-stack development**,  
while exploring the intersection of **AI technologies and human-oriented applications**.  

In my postgraduate studies,  
I aim to further investigate **artificial intelligence, data systems, and human–computer interaction**,  
and to apply computing technologies to enhance human well-being — particularly in the preservation of memory, emotion, and connection.  

> Technology’s true value lies not only in innovation but in empathy and understanding.  
> I aspire to continue bridging technology with humanity through meaningful, socially impactful computing.
